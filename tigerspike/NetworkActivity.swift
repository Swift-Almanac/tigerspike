//  NAIM sets the spinning wheel in the top left of the phone to indicate Network Activity.
//  I have included a mechanism to pass closure functions which are queued and implemented
//  once the network operation has completed.
//  As there can be many async calls at one time, loadingCount keeps a track of how many
//  calls are outstanding. Completion Functions are called when there are no more networking
//  events outstanding.
